# DumbItDown
## Inspiration
Ever found yourself scratching your head over dense medical reports or technical documents? Yeah, we've been there too! Dumb It Down swoops in like a friendly neighbourhood helper to simplify all that jargon and make complex stuff a breeze to understand.

## What it does
Dumb It Down is your go-to buddy for breaking down those wordy documents. Just snap a pic of the report or upload an image, and let the magic happen! Our tool uses OCR (that's Optical Character Recognition) to decipher the text and serves up a neat summary pronto.

## How I built it
I cooked up Dumb It Down using a secret recipe of Tesseract for text recognition, OpenAI for those genius-level summaries, and a sprinkle of Django and Python to tie it all together. The result? A user-friendly app that's as easy as pie to navigate.

## Challenges I ran into
Oh boy, where do we start? From waiting on LLama 2 approval to brushing up on our Django skills, it's been quite the rollercoaster ride. And let's not forget the solo hustle – juggling everything within the time crunch was definitely a challenge!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Despite the hurdles, I'm stoked to say I have nailed the basics of Dumb It Down! Seeing my vision come to life, one step at a time, has been nothing short of awesome.

## What I learned
This journey taught me more than just tech stuff – I learned the ins and outs of Django, got cozy with OpenAI, and dipped my toes into the world of OCR. Talk about a crash course in cool tech!

## What's next for Dumb It Down
The adventure doesn't end here! I've got big plans, like adding support for different file types, letting you snap pics right from the app, and fine-tuning our OCR skills to tackle even the trickiest documents. Stay tuned for more awesomeness!
